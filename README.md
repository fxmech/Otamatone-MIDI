The neck slider pot is not a potentiometer, but rather a rheostat, so while my wiring solution works, the output rage is limited from the usual 1024 steps down to 500...  I will need to revisit this.

The software has 3 modes.  
1: similar to original where the neck is just a long pitch bend wheel
2: Neck is mapped into a specific Major scale
3: Neck is mapped into a specific minor scale
The mode is mapped to the original 3 position switch on the Otamatone.

The Original volume know is also used to send midi signals to control volume or anything else you choose to map it too.
